# RP-Names

## DESCRIPTION 
> The plugin allows you to add role play nicknames to your pmmp server, for example: Andrey Kharkov

In version 0.1, it is possible to set only a role play nickname. However, in the next updates, a "Unique ID" will be added, which will allow for each player to set a non-replaceable ID, through which it will be easier to perform various operations with the player.
